Welcome to the **Candy Crush Game**, a fun and interactive project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project recreates the essence of the classic Candy Crush game, where players match candies to score points and progress through levels. The game features a visually appealing grid of colorful candies, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and dynamic scoring systems. Built with web technologies, this version of Candy Crush is designed to be responsive, ensuring smooth performance across devices.  

In the game, players aim to match three or more candies of the same type in a row or column to clear them and earn points. Matched candies disappear, and new ones cascade down to fill the gaps, creating opportunities for combo matches. Players can swap adjacent candies to create matches, but only valid moves are allowed. The challenge lies in strategically planning moves to achieve the highest score possible within a limited number of turns or time. The game provides an engaging mix of strategy and fun, making it an enjoyable experience for all ages.  

Feel free to explore, play, and modify the code to enhance the game further!
